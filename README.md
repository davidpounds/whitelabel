# White label admin proof of concept

This is a React app that allows users to choose values for a white label implementation of a website using an admin interface.

The app generates the custom CSS using CSS Custom Properties for the values. It also handles setting one value to the value of another value to allow for simple rebranding without having to change lots of values.
